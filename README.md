# Automatic-Fruit-Classification-Detection-and-Counting-using-Computer-Vision-and-Machine Learning Algorithms
Nowadays, one of the biggest challenge in front of fruit farmers is to the count number of fruits on
the trees manually. During manual counting of fruit, quality of fruit may degrade because fruits
move from one basket to another basket. The automated fruit sorting, detection and counting
approach can help farmers to speed up time for processing and requires less labor. This work
presents automatic classification of fruits by using deep neural network and machine-learning
algorithms. Computer vision techniques are used for on tree fruit detection and counting. In deep
neural network a new model has been proposed by using own dataset on which fine tuning
operations performed on pre-trained VGG-16 model. In machine learning approach various
supervised algorithms such as decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, linear
discriminant analysis, support vector machine, gaussian naive bayes are used but amongst them K-
nearest neighbor algorithm show better accuracy at K=5 because it predicts accurate result by
considering labels of five nearest neighbors around test sample. Deep neural network classify fruits
under shadow, occluded by foliage, branches and during overlap amongst fruits. Hence, deep neural
network more accurately classify fruits as compare to machine learning approach. This project not
only work for images but also for video sequences. This proposed system accurately classify, detect
and count on tree fruit which will help the framers in robotic harvesting of fruits and in precision
farming. The main objective of this work is to reduce input cost, minimize work time, improve fruit
quality and increase the yield of fruits.
